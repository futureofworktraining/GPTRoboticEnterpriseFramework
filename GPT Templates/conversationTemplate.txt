The selector is not working. Please create a new one. Think how the selector can be improved using guidlines below:

- Make sure that attributes are relevant for the given UI element. 
- Try using 'parrentclass' instead of 'class' attribute.
- Remove or add some attributes like: 'class', 'aaname', if needed.
- The new selector cannot be the same like  the previous one.
- You may need to remove 'aaname' attribute from the button selector.
- Do not use attributes like 'onclick'.
